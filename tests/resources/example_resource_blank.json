He remembers the brutality of existence of which he saw too much during the war and in his efforts to express thought without the con trol of reason he has opened himself to the wounds of society which he sees fester with intense and morbid curiosity Surrealisme is a form of intellectual Sadis that attempts to sublimate itself through Freudian do trines and dream symbols",
